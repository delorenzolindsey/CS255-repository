Brief summary of this project;
Within this project, I was given a project by the company DriverPass. This company wished to have a system created from student drivers to login, study notes, take practice quizes, take tests, and schedule on-the-roads driving tests.

What did I do particularly well?
I grasp the materials and concepts of what the company was looking for easily. However, applying that I understood was not shown as well as it could have. There is much to learn for creating diagrams, not just explaining them.

If I could select a part to revise, what would I change?
I would practice more with creating diagrams. I feel all the ones I made are missing so much and I have so much more to learn. I am sure I will be better at it with time and practice.

How did I interpret the user's needs and why is that important?
Understanding the user is the first step to understanding the target audience. Understanding your customer and how they will use the system will help the development team understand what features to add to get the system running effienctly. I have to remember I am not just making a system, but an easy system for the customer to use. Why would a customer use a system that is harder to operate if there is an easier competitor system? The system needs to fit the users' needs and the company's design.

How do I approach the designing of the software? What techniques can I use for future analysing and desgining?
I like to mix the diagrams and use the different styles. I think each one helps see a different side of the system and how it need to be designed. The USE case diagram for example is a good example of the requirements of the different parts of the system. The USE case is easier to understand the feature of the system but not how to develop. The Class diagrams are wonderful for explaining the classes, attributes, and relationships for the object in the system. This is a great diagram for developers, but not easy to understand from a client's view. Using both would help to explain and have the best communication between the different parts of the creation team.
